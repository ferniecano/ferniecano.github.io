                        In 2023, I made the decision to leave everything I knew behind. 
                        I had a Finance degree, but I was very unhappy. I decided that I wanted
                        to do something that I was passionate and loved. It was then that
                        I decided to change my life and learn how to code. I didn't want to go
                        back to school, so I signed up for a free introductory course on edx.org, which
                        lead to me enrolling into the Coursera Meta Front-End Development Certificate. 
                        I have already enrolled into the Back-End Certificate to learn that as well.
